learning d3 maps: create from topojson, apply data by region

This example has been pilfered from the gist ["Choropleth U.S. county map"](http://bl.ocks.org/jadiehm/af4a00140c213dfbc4e6)
to provide a basis for further exploration and experiment.

This webapp requires a simple http server in order to run.   One way to do this,
using python 3.5 or later:

```
cd <this repo directory>
python -m http.server 8081

```

Then browse to

```
http://localhost:8081
```
